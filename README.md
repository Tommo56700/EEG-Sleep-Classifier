# EEG-Sleep-Classifier

Final year university solo project: "Evaluating Deep Learning Techniques for Automated Sleep Stage Scoring of EEG Data"


Sleep stage scoring is the first step in the quantitative analysis of polysomnographic recordings. Scoring is usually performed manually by at least two qualified sleep technologists. Manual scoring carries limitations of inter-rate reliability and time demands of sleep technologists. Recent developments have considered the use of artificial neural networks to solve this problem autonomously. This project evaluates the use of 8 different neural network models, specifically taking inspiration from newer developments in the wider fields of time series classification and digital signal processing. Model design is discussed in detail and the final evaluations are made from experiments on two datasets from Cardiff Universityâ€™s Neuroscience and Psychology of Sleep Laboratory. The resulting system designed for the project is a neural network test-ground where models are capable of classifying sleep stages to a high degree of accuracy.
